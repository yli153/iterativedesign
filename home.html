		<div class = "row" >
			<p>
				Iterative prototyping is an essential part of creating user interfaces. In this project, we design an interface for a startup from scratch using only 
				their concept; we did not use anything they’ve already built such as logo, images, or content. Afterwards, we iterated on our design based on feedback from 
				classmates and an industry critic, and tested our final prototype on real users through usertesting.com.

	              	<ol type="1">  
	                <li> 
	                  Discover events, where creators can discover and sign up for events hosted by creators in categories such as food, fitness, tech, and more. 
	                </li> 
	                <li>
	                  Host events, where creators can host their own events and customize parameters ranging from category, time, to ticket price. 
	                </li>
	                <li>
	                  Event analytics, where creators can gain detailed insights into their earnings breakdown and data from past events they have hosted. 
					</li>
					</ol>
          		</div>
			</div>
			<p>
				Our target user group is lifestyle creators, especially those hoping to profit from their contents and discover contents from fellow creators. 
				Since these creators mostly produce and livestream contents on their computers, we decided to create a web interface to enable easier access 
				and more flexible layouts. 
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class = "row">
			<h4 id = "sketches">
				Sketches
			</h4>
		</div>
		<div class = "row">
			<p>
				Each member of our group drew a set of sketches for at least three different pages: home page, event page, and analytics page. Our design for the 
				event page differed a lot. Sally's design only showed the categories of the event to the users when they landed on the event page, and the users 
				would find out the information about the events after they clicked on the category they are interested in. Sophia's design showed the featured events 
				of each category on the event page. In contrast, Yuxiao's design only showed a list of the events of the default category (for example, fashion), and 
				it would present the events in other categories after users clicked on the corresponding filters. Angela designed the event page from the point of creators. 
				Creators could edit event information and see attendees information on the page.

			<p>
				After we finished sketching, our group had a meeting to discuss our designs and combined the sketches above into a set of wireframes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Without logging in, users could only see the Home and Explore Events pages. They could only see the remaining pages of the website after 
				logging in, as we believed this design choice would prompt more users to register for the site. This way, more users would be likely to become 
				loyal to Reach.live as the company could then potentially reach out to them through email advertisements.  Moreover, since the company is in 
				its startup stage, we believed having more loyal users would be beneficial both in terms of scale and profitability.
			</p>
		</div>

			<div class = "jumbotron jumbo-image-2">
				<h5><b>Home and Explore Events</b></h5>
				<img class="sketch-2" src="images/home_and_explore.png" alt="home page and explore events lo-fi">

				<h6><b>Home Page</b></h6>
				<p>The Home page contains several vertically stacked sections, each showcasing a different aspect of the company. We all agreed that Reach.live 
					is a platform for creators to both host and participate in events, and strived to show this by displaying information relating to these two aspects. 
					These include sections of discover events, host events, monetize events, and live interactions. 
				</p>
				<h6><b>Explore Events Page</b></h6>
				<p>The Explore Events page shows a set of featured events under each category. We chose to present all categories on one page without using any filter 
					or tabs because this would make the page look more straightforward and require fewer interactions, thus creating a more effortless experience for 
					first-time users.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class = "row">
			<p>
				After logging into their accounts, users could see three tabs, events, analytics and account, which correspond to three pages. 
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class = "row small-header">
			<div class = "jumbotron jumbo-image-2">
				<h5><b>Events and Analytics (logged in)</b></h5>
				<img class="sketch-2" src="images/events_and_analytics.png" alt="account and analytics lo-fi">

				<h6><b>Events Page</b></h6>
				<p>
					There are two sections on the Events page: 1. Discover Events 2. My Events. In the Discover Events section, users would see events 
					in the default category, and they could view events of other categories when they clicked on the corresponding tabs. We made this design 
					choice instead of showing events from different categories all together as we believed this would help users discover the events that they
					 want to attend more easily.</p>

				<h6><b>Analytics Page</b></h6>
				<p>The Analytics page contains a dashboard displaying a summary of important metrics, and several charts displaying detailed breakdowns of each metric. 
					We made this design decision because we felt it was important for creators to gain insights into events they have hosted, and all of us drew an 
					individual analytics page in our sketches.</p>

				<h5><b>Account and Host Events Pop-Up (logged in)</b></h5>
				<img class="sketch-2" src="images/account_and_host.png" alt="account and host events pop up lo-fi">
				<h6><b>Account Page</b></h6>
				<p>The Account page enables user to view and edit important information about user profile, password, email, and payments which needs to be viewed or 
					modified on a regular basis. </p>

				<h6><b>Host Events Pop-Up Page</b></h6>
				<p>The popup page can be activated on all major pages as the button is located on the top of the page. We decided to put the “Host Event” button in a more 
					obvious position for navigation and usability reasons. The page requires content creators to input basic information such as what the event is about, time 
					of the event, and how much the event costs.</p>

				High-Fidelity Prototype: Iteration 1
			</h4>
		</div>

		<div class = "row" >
			<p>Combining insights from the wireframes and branding, we then created the high-fidelity prototypes. </p>

			<p>We first decided on a visual style that would attract the target audience of Reach.live by experimenting different colour palettes and visual 
				   elements. In the end, we decided to use orange as the theme colour because of its positive connotations and the vitality that it gives off to people. 
				   Additionally, we chose a curly font for titles to make it a more fun experience. Titles are in orange, subtitles are in dark blue, and texts 
				   are in black. The design choices we made are consistent for all the pages in the mockup. Below are some of the key features in the Hi-Fi mockup 
				   that we highlighted. 
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class = "row small-header">
			<div class = "jumbotron jumbo-image-2">
				<h5><b>Home Page Before User Login (left)</b></h5>
				<p>The Home page introduces what Reach.live is and illustrates how users can use the platform to attend events, host events, and interact with attendees. 
					We used images to directly show what the platform offers. </p>

				<h5><b>Explore Events Page Before User Login (right)</b></h5>
				<p>The Explore Events page enables users to quickly look at events hosted on Reach.live. The events are divided based on different categories. Events that are 
					approaching will be prioritized and appear first. This is an important page to incentivize users to sign up given it’s a startup trying to attract first time users. </p>
				<img class="hifi" src="images/home_events.png" alt="home page and explore events hi-fi">
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class = "row small-header">
			<div class = "jumbotron jumbo-image-2">
				<h5><b>Home Page After User Login (left)</b></h5>
				<p>The Home page allows registered users to discover events, register for events, and attend events. For layout hierarchy, we put the most important information on the 
					left. The top left of the page has a navigation bar for users to quickly navigate to the analytics page and the account page. There is also the  “My Events” section 
					that presents all the events that a user has signed up for. </p>

				<h5><b>Host Events Pop Up (right)</b></h5>
				<p>The Host Event button on the Home page activates a pop up window which allows users to quickly host an event on Reach.live. For users, this design choice is easy to 
					navigate. The “Host an Event” page has affordances that help users understand without stating it in words. </p>
				<img class="hifi" src="images/home_host_events.png" alt="home and host event pop-up hi-fi">
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class = "row small-header">
			<div class = "jumbotron jumbo-image-2">
				<h5><b>Analytics Page (left)</b></h5>
				<p>The Analytics page uses both qualitative and quantitative data to help creators achieve and track their goals on the platform including their cumulative earnings, streaming hours, 
					followers, and views.</p>

				<h5><b>Account Page (right)</b></h5>
				<p>The Account page enables users to quickly view and change their user profile information, security settings, and payments. </p>
				<img class="hifi" src="images/accounts_analytics.png" alt="account and analytics hi-fi">
			</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class = "row">
			<h4 id = "hi-fi2">High-Fidelity Prototype: Iteration 2</h4>
			<p>During our studio, we received many suggestions that were especially helpful for our second iteration Hi-Fi Mockup design. After rounds of discussions on issues brought up in the studio, 
				we made major design changes in our new mockup by adding the following features and elements. </p>
		</div>

		<div class = "row small-header">
			<div class = "jumbotron jumbo-image-2">
				<h5><b>Logout Button</b></h5>
				<p>During the studio, users reflected the mockup does not provide an easy way to logout and switch accounts. Therefore, in the second iteration, we designed and added a link on the 
					navigation bar right beside the “Welcome, Emily” to provide users with an option to sign out if needed. This enhances the overall usability of the website, and provides easy access 
					for people to switch accounts. </p>
				<img class="hifi" src="images/home_iterations.png" alt="events home page iteration">
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class = "row small-header">
			<div class = "jumbotron jumbo-image-2">
				<h5><b>Filter Events Dropdown Menu</b></h5>
				<p>Another feedback was that the events page would benefit from filtering options regarding the type and time of events. Therefore, we designed 3 filter options in the home page to help 
					users quickly identify events that are interesting to them (the type) at a time that they can attend (the date and time).</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Date:</b> One of the most helpful critiques we received is that people prioritize dates in deciding what events to sign up for. Therefore, we added a filter and a drop down menu 
								for users to select the dates that they are looking to register an event for. The options range from both longer timeframes like “this month” to dates that are approaching 
								like “today” and “tomorrow”. </li>
						<li><b>Time:</b> In addition to dates, users in our studio reflect that the time in the day is also very important when they make a decision on what events to attend. For example, many 
								people have work during the day and cannot attend events before 5pm. Also, some users prefer early morning workout events especially because of work from home due to COVID. 
								So, we added a drop down menu with different options: “all day”, “before 7am”, “7am-noon”, “noon to 5pm”, “5-10pm”, and “after 10pm. </li>
					</ul>
				<img class="hifi" src="images/events_iterations.png" alt="events dropdown filter iteration">
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class = "row small-header">
			<div class = "jumbotron jumbo-image-2">
				<h5><b>Monetization Insights</b></h5>
				<p>People also felt a need to gain more qualitative insights about events they have hosted, in addition to the charts and pie graphs. Therefore, in the analytics page, we added an “Insight” 
					section with the following 4 quick insights that can help the creator to quickly reflect and make better content decisions. </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Most Profitable Earning Component</li>
						<li>Most Profitable Content Type</li>
						<li>Major Follower Age Group </li>
						<li>Most Viewed Content</li>
					</ul>

			</div>
		</div>

		<div class = "row small-header">
			<div class = "jumbotron jumbo-image-2">
				<h5><b>Events Sign-Up</b></h5>
				<p>There was also suggestion on the sign-up function. In particular, one of our peers said that the "plus" sign was a bit hard to notice and he wasn't completely sure about
					what that button would do. Therefore, we changed all the “plus” signs to "sign up" buttons to make them stand out so that they are more obvious to users.</p>
				<p><i>Left: first iteration; Right: second iteration</i></p>
				<img class="hifi" src="images/sign_up_button_iterations.png" alt="events sign-up iteration">
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class = "row small-header">
			<div class = "jumbotron jumbo-image-2">
				<h5><b>Accesibility</b></h5>
				<p>We were cautious of potential accessibility issues during our design stage. Especially for the graphs on our analytics page, our team made sure that 
					there are enough colour contrasts in the pie charts and data charts. </p>

				User Testing: Results and Analysis
			</h4>
		<p>To see how real users would interact with our website, we conducted user testing and collected feedback. Since our platform is open to anyone, we did not post any demographic requirements for 
			test participants. We provided the users with a brief introduction of our platform and requested them to complete the task of logging into a user account and browsing through available events 
			and account analytics. The setup of our user testing including the four required sub-tasks and post-test questions are shown below. The sub-tasks we selected are closely related to our core 
			business function which is to allow anyone to discover, host and monetize events. </p>

					The results from user testing aligned with our expectations and turned out to be very positive. One common thing they all mentioned was that the website is easy to navigate, simple, clear and 
					well-put together. When watching their interactions with our site, we recognized that they all liked its modern and personal feel and appreciated its clear layout. The responses and comments from the three 
					users are summarized below. </p>

			<h4>Conclusion</h4>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<p>This project was an invaluable opportunity for us to practice the entire iterative design process, from ideation, wire framing, prototyping, to evaluation. 
				By merging everyone’s differing sketches and making improvements based on critiques from classmates and industry experts, we learned various good practices 
				of designing a clear, intuitive interface such as the importance of a coherent visual identity and clear navigation. Moreover, based on the user’s performance 
				and feedback, we would like to make the following improvements to our interface in the future:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Change the “See More” button to “See Events” which will better inform the users about the page they will be directed to</li>
					<li>Change the “Account” tab to “My Profile” which might better distinguish from “Analytics”</li>
					<li>Add a pop-up window which shows up whenever the users sign up for a particular event, asking them to confirm their registration</li>
					<li>Add a page for “My Schedule” which will make it easier for the users to keep track of all the upcoming and past events they will and have participated in</li>
				</ol>
