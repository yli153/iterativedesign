				Iterative prototyping is an essential part of creating user interfaces. In this project, we design an interface for a startup from scratch using only 
				their concept; we did not use anything they’ve already built such as logo, images, or content. Afterwards, we iterated on our design based feedback from 
				classmates and an industry critic, and tested our final prototype on real users through usertesting.com.

	                </li> 
	                <li>
	                  Host events, where creators can host their own events and customize parameters ranging from category, time, to ticket price.

	                <li>
	                  Event analytics, where creators can gain detailed insights into their earnings breakdown and data from past events they have hosted.

				Our target user group is lifestyle creators, especially those hoping to profit from their contents and discover contents from fellow creators. 
				Since these creators mostly use produce and livestream contents on their computers, we decided to create a web interface to enable easier access 
				and more flexible layouts. 
			</p>

				Sketches
			</h4>
		</div>
		<div class = "row">
			<p>
				Each member of our group drew a set of sketches for at least three different pages: home page, event page, and analytics page. Our design for the 
				event page differed a lot. Sally's design only showed the categories of the event to the users when they landed on the event page, and the users 
				would find out the information about the events after they clicked on the category they are interested in. Sophia's design showed the featured events 
				of each category on the event page. In contrast, Yuxiao's design only showed a list of the events of the default category (for example, fashion), and 
				it would present the events in other categories after users clicked on the corresponding filters. Angela designed the event page from the point of creators. 
				Creators could edit event information and see attendees information on the page.

				After we finished sketching, our group had a meeting to discuss our designs and combine the sketches above into a set of wireframes.

			<p>
				Without logging in, users could only see the Home page and the Explore Events page.  Users would only see the remaining pages of the website 
				after they have logged in, as we believed this design choice would make more users register for our website. If users are registered, then they are 
				more likely to become loyal users, because Reach.live could reach out to users through email and advertise their events. Since Reach.live is a startup, 
				we believed having more loyal users would be really beneficial to Reach.live. If more users are loyal to Reach. live, Reach.live will be likely to be more profitable.

				<h5><b>Home and Explore Events</b></h5>
				<img class="sketch-2" src="images/home_and_explore.png" alt="home page and explore events lo-fi">

				<h6><b>Home Page</b></h6>
				<p>
					We all agreed that Reach.live is a platform for both the event participants and the creators. Hence, we put the information (such as discover events, host events, 
					monetize events, and live interactions with other participants and creators) that these two groups of people that would be interested in on the home page. 
				</p>
				<h6><b>Explore Events Page</b></h6>
				<p>
					The explore events page showed a set of featured events under each category. We chose to present all categories on one page without using any filter or tabs because 
					this would make the page look straightforward and would require fewer user interactions. 
				</p>

				<p>
					There are two sections on the events page: 1. Discover Events 2. My Events. In the Discover Events section, users would see events 
					in the default category, and they could view events of other categories when they clicked on the corresponding tabs. We made this design 
					choice instead of showing events from different categories all together as we believed this would help users discover the events that they
					 want to attend more clearly.

				High-Fidelity Prototype: Iteration 1
			</h4>
		</div>

		<div class = "row" >
			<p>Creating the visual design of the high-fi mockup was a process that brings together insights from the wireframe and branding. </p>

			<p>We first decided on a visual style that attracts the target audience of reach.live by experimenting different colour palettes and visual 
				   elements. In the end, we decided to use orange as the theme colour because of its connotations and the vibe that it gives off to people. 
				   Additionally, we chose a curly font for titles to make it a more fun experience. Titles are in orange, subtitles are in dark blue, and texts 
				   are in black. The design choices we made are consistent for all the pages in the mockup. Below are some of the key features in the Hi-Fi mockup 
				   that we highlighted. 
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class = "row small-header">
			<div class = "jumbotron jumbo-image-2">
				<h5><b>Home Page Before User Login (left)</b></h5>
				<p>The home page introduces what reach.live is, and illustrates how users can use the platform to attend events, host events, and interact with attendees. 
					We used images to directly show what the platform offers. </p>

				<h5><b>Explore Events Page Before User Login (right)</b></h5>
				<p>The explore events page enables users to quickly look at events hosted on reach.live. The events are divided based on different categories. Events that are 
					approaching will be prioritized and appear first. This is an important page to incentivize users to sign up given it’s a startup trying to attract first time users. </p>
				<img class="hifi" src="images/home_events.png" alt="home page and explore events hi-fi">
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class = "row small-header">
			<div class = "jumbotron jumbo-image-2">
				<h5><b>Home Page After User Login (left)</b></h5>
				<p>The home page allows registered users to discover events, register for events, and attend events. For layout hierarchy, we put the most important information on the 
					left. The top left of the page has a navigation bar for users to quickly navigate to the analytics page and the account page. There is also the  “My Events” section 
					that presents all the events that a user has signed up for. </p>

				<h5><b>Host Events Pop Up (right)</b></h5>
				<p>The host events button on the home page activates a pop up window which allows users to quickly host an event on reach.live. For users, this design choice is easy to 
					navigate. The “host event” page has affordances that help users understand without stating it in words. </p>
				<img class="hifi" src="images/home_host_events.png" alt="home and host event pop-up hi-fi">
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class = "row small-header">
			<div class = "jumbotron jumbo-image-2">
				<h5><b>Analytics Page (left)</b></h5>
				<p>The page uses both qualitative and quantitative data to help creators achieve and track their goals on the platform including their cumulative earnings, streaming hours, 
					followers, and views.</p>

				<h5><b>Accounts Page (right)</b></h5>
				<p>The accounts page enables users to quickly view and change their user profile information, security settings, and payments. </p>
				<img class="hifi" src="images/accounts_analytics.png" alt="account and analytics hi-fi">
			</div>

		<div class = "row">
			<h4 id = "hi-fi2">High-Fidelity Prototype: Iteration 2</h4>
			<p>During our studio, we received many feedbacks that were especially helpful for our 2nd iteration Hi-Fi Mockup design. After rounds of discussions on issues brought up in the studio, 
				we made major design changes in our new mockup by adding the following features and elements. </p>
		</div>

		<div class = "row small-header">
			<div class = "jumbotron jumbo-image-2">
				<h5><b>Logout Button</b></h5>
				<p>During the studio, users reflected the mockup does not provide an easy way to logout and switch accounts. Therefore, in the 2nd iteration, we designed and added a link on the 
					navigation bar right beside the “Welcome, Emily” to provide users with an option to sign out if needed. This enhances the overall usability of the website, and provides easy access 
					for people to switch accounts. </p>
				<img class="hifi" src="images/home_iterations.png" alt="events home page iteration">
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class = "row small-header">
			<div class = "jumbotron jumbo-image-2">
				<h5><b>Filter Events Dropdown Menu</b></h5>
				<p>We designed 3 filter options in the home page to help users quickly identify events that are interesting to them(the type) at a time that they can attend (the date and time).</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Date:</b> One of the most helpful critiques we received is people prioritize dates in deciding what events to sign up for. Therefore, we added a filter and a drop down menu 
								for users to select the dates that they are looking to register an event for. The options range from both longer timeframes like “this month” to dates that are approaching 
								like “today” and “tomorrow”. </li>
						<li><b>Time:</b> In addition to dates, users in our studio reflect that the time in the day is also very important when they make a decision on what events to attend. For example, many 
								people have work during the day and cannot attend events before 5pm. Also, some users prefer early morning workout events especially because of work from home due to COVID. 
								So, we added a drop down menu with different options: “all day”, “before 7am”, “7am-noon”, “noon to 5pm”, “5-10pm”, and “after 10pm. </li>
					</ul>

		</div>

		<div class = "row small-header">
			<div class = "jumbotron jumbo-image-2">
				<h5><b>Monetization Insights</b></h5>
				<p>During the studio, we recognized creators appreciate qualitative insights in addition to the charts and pie graphs. Therefore, in the analytics page, we added an “Insight” section with the 
					following 4 quick insights that can help the creator to quickly reflect and make better content decisions. </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Most Profitable Earning Component</li>
						<li>Most Profitable Content Type</li>
						<li>Major Follower Age Group </li>
						<li>Most Viewed Content</li>
					</ul>

		<div class = "row small-header">
			<div class = "jumbotron jumbo-image-2">
				<h5><b>Events Sign-Up</b></h5>
				<p>We made buttons that are most important for the user experience such as the “sign up” button stand out so it’s more obvious to users.</p>
				<p><i>Left: first iteration; Right: second iteration</i></p>
				<img class="hifi" src="images/sign_up_button_iterations.png" alt="events sign-up iteration">

		<div class = "row small-header">
			<div class = "jumbotron jumbo-image-2">
				<h5><b>Accesibility</b></h5>
				<p>We were cautious of potential accessibility issues during our design stage. And for pie graphs in our analytics page, our team made sure that 
					there are enough colour contrasts in the pie charts and data charts. </p>

				User Testing: Results and Analysis
			</h4>
		<p>To see how real users would interact with our website, we conducted user testing and collected feedback. Since our platform is open to anyone, we did not post any demographic requirements for 
			test participants. We provided the users with a brief introduction of our platform and requested them to complete the task of logging into a user account and browsing through available events 
			and account analytics. The setup of our user testing including the four required sub-tasks and post-test questions are shown below. The sub-tasks we selected are closely related to our core 
			business function which is to allow anyone to discover, host and monetize events. </p>

				<p>We expect the users to be able to complete the sub-tasks easily without any confusion given our intentional design of clear menu options, minimum number of buttons and intuitive layout. 
					The results from user testing align with our expectations and turn out to be very positive. One common thing they all mention is that the website is easy to navigate, simple, clear and 
					well-put together. When watching their interactions with our site, they all like its modern and personal feel and appreciate its current layout. The responses and comments from the three 
					users are summarized below. </p>

				<h5><b>Analysis of the Sub-tasks Performance</b></h5>
				<p>In general, the users not only find all four tasks easy to complete, but are also confident that they have completed the tasks successfully. The durations of time they spend on each task 
					are very similar and no one seems to struggle with a particular task. Though none of the users made an error, there were few moments when some users felt slightly unsure about their actions.

						<li>Change the “See More” button to “See Events” which will better inform the users about the page they will be directed to</li>
						<li>Change the “Account” tab to “My Profile” which might better distinguish from “Analytics”</li>
						<li>Add a pop-up window which shows up whenever the users sign up for a particular event, asking them to confirm their registration</li>
						<li>Add a page for “My Schedule” which will make it easier for the users to keep track of all the upcoming and past events they will and have participated in</li>
